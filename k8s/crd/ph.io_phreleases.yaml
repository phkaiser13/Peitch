#
# This file defines the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for the phRelease
# resource. This CRD is the cornerstone of the progressive delivery system,
# providing a high-level, declarative API for managing complex release
# strategies like Canary and Blue-Green deployments.
#
# Architecture:
# - It establishes the 'phRelease' kind within the 'ph.io' API group.
# - The `spec` is designed to be abstract and user-friendly. A user specifies
#   *what* they want (e.g., a Canary release of version 1.2.0 with automated
#   metric analysis and promotion) without needing to know the low-level
#   details of manipulating Deployments, Services, or service mesh resources.
# - The ph-operator will watch for changes to phRelease resources and translate
#   this high-level intent into the necessary low-level Kubernetes resource
#   manipulations.
# - The `spec` has been extended to include an `analysis` section, allowing
#   users to define Prometheus queries and success criteria. This enables the
#   operator to automatically validate the health of a new version before
#   promoting it or rolling it back.
# - The `status` field provides a detailed, real-time view of the release's
#   progress, including the current phase (e.g., Progressing, Promoting, Failed),
#   the results of metric analyses, and any conditions or errors encountered
#   during the rollout.
# - This CRD forms the core of the Release Orchestrator's intelligent and
#   automated deployment capabilities.
